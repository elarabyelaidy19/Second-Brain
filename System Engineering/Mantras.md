## Bits Vs Bytes 

- 1 byte = 8 bits
- When measuring data transfer rates (e.g., internet speed), it's common to use bits per second (bps) or its multiples like kilobits per second (Kbps) or megabits per second (Mbps).
- File sizes and storage capacities are often measured in bytes or their multiples like kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), etc. 
- Bytes are commonly used in the context of file sizes, memory capacities, and data storage.
- Bits are often used in the context of data transmission rates, network speeds, and signal processing. 
~~~
Bytes = numBits / 8 
bits = bytes x 8
