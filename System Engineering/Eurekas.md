## Bits Vs Bytes 

- 1 byte = 8 bits
- When measuring data transfer rates (e.g., internet speed), it's common to use bits per second (bps) or its multiples like kilobits per second (Kbps) or megabits per second (Mbps).
- File sizes and storage capacities are often measured in bytes or their multiples like kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), etc. 
- Bytes are commonly used in the context of file sizes, memory capacities, and data storage.
- Bits are often used in the context of data transmission rates, network speeds, and signal processing. 
~~~
Bytes = numBits / 8 
bits = bytes x 8

## Compression  
[Data Compression](https://www.barracuda.com/support/glossary/data-compression)

> Data compression is a process of reducing the size of data or files to optimize storage space, transmission, and processing. Compression is crucial in various computing applications, including file archiving, data transmission over networks, and storage efficiency.

**Lossless vs. Lossy Compression:**
- **Lossless Compression:** Preserves all original data, and the decompressed data is identical to the original. Commonly used for text files, executables, and archival purposes.
- **Lossy Compression:** Sacrifices some data to achieve higher compression ratios. Commonly used for multimedia files like images, audio, and video. 

**Compression Algorithms:**
- Various algorithms are used for compression, such as Huffman coding, Run-Length Encoding (RLE), and Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT).
